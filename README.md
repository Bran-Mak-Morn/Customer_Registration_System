Customer Registration System - for a fictional company

Project Description: Customer Registration System

Welcome to my first GitHub project! 

This Python project showcases my programming skills and problem-solving approach. 
It's a simple customer registration system developed from scratch, focusing on foundational Python programming and object-oriented principles. 
I am going to make it better and add some database soon :)

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Utilizes classes like Customer and UpgradedCustomer for flexibility and organization. 
Input Validation: Ensures data integrity with input validation for customer details. 
Security Measures: Implements basic access control using decorators for sensitive operations. 
Error Handling: Proactively addresses potential issues with effective error handling throughout the codebase. 
Documentation: Includes clear docstrings for enhanced code readability and understanding.
